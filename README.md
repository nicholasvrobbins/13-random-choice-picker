Summary: Following along with Brad and Florin's 50 Projects in 50 Days to better understand JavaScript.

Today's project was a doozy. We used a lot of JavaScript and created a random choice picker using event listeners on keyup, using if() statements that if we press enter then it will randomlyselect a tag a certain number of times (30 in this case), it will highlight them briefly, unhighlight them afterwards and then pick one after 3 seconds. I enjoy the random picked projects, utilizing the combo of Math.floor(Math.random() \* variable.length) to create those random selections. I'm also grasping not only how to make functions but how to organize and place elements within them. For example, the function randomSelect() has multiple steps before it's complete such as 1) The amount of times it will select an element for potential picking, 2) Setting the interval to 100 ms per highlight then unhighlight said element, 3) And then setting the timeout of said interval.

It's cool seeing how Brad adds functions that he hasn't yet created inside of his current functions, almost as if he's saying, "We're going to add this pickRandomTag() function here, even though we haven't created it yet, but we will need it for this function to work and then we'll create it afterwards." It's a very interesting way of structuring the project and great to see how great programmers think outloud. Really enjoyed this project and spent some extra time going back through each chunk of code to just examine it.
